Banks solved the problem for people of portability and security of their wealth.

Banks provide for people the ability to travel around the world and claim their wealth at branches, while also keeping their money secure. In exchange for these services, banks can use the money. Banks act as the central hub that matches deposited money to other people looking to borrow it. Out of the money they charge for being the matchmaker, they give the depositor back a bit and keep the rest. Simple as that.

Without banks, there would be no place to match people looking to lend and people looking to borrow, so banks are necessary to keep the markets active.


Imagine a big swimming pool full of cash. Anyone can come up to it and do one of two things: throw more cash in or take some cash out. That’s it. At a very basic level, this is how Aave works . Aave allows anyone in the world to add and subtract cash from a money pool in exchange for interest  —  aka to lend and borrow. 


AAVE liquidity protocol. formerly known as ETHLend, was founded in 2017

Aave (which means “ghost” in Finnish) was originally known as ETHLend when it launched in November 2017, but the rebranding to Aave happened in September 2018.

Aave is a decentralized lending platform built on top of the Ethereum network

Stani Kulechov is the founder of AAVE liquidity protocol.

Kulechov is a serial entrepreneur who went to law school and began programming when he was a teenager. He was an early adopter in the blockchain space. The CEO has said that he wanted to rebrand ETHLend as Aave so the company could offer a wider range of services beyond Ether lending.

The idea for AAVE liquidity protocol came about from Stani Kulechov's experience in using other DeFi protocols, where he realized that there were several limitations and inefficiencies that could be addressed by creating a new platform. 

Lenders earn interest by depositing digital assets into specially created liquidity pools. Borrowers can then use their crypto as collateral to take out a flash loan using this liquidity.

AAVE liquidity protocol has raised a total of $14.9 million in funding to date. The company has received funding from several investors, including Blockchain Capital, Standard Crypto, and Blockchain.com Ventures.


## Business Activities:

AAVE liquidity protocol aims to solve the problem of limited access to credit and financial services in the traditional banking system by providing a decentralized platform for lending and borrowing digital assets.

The project allows people to borrow and lend in about 20 cryptocurrencies, meaning that users have a greater amount of choice. One of Aave’s flagship products are “flash loans,” which have been billed as the first uncollateralized loan option in the DeFi space. There’s a catch: they must be paid back within the same transaction.

Another big selling point is how those who borrow through Aave can alternate between fixed and variable interest rates. While fixed rates can provide some certainty about costs during times of volatility in the crypto markets, variable rates can come in handy if the borrower thinks that prices will fall in the near future.

AAVE liquidity protocol's intended customers are individuals and institutions who want to lend and borrow digital assets without the need for a centralized intermediary. The market size for this set of customers is difficult to estimate, but it is growing rapidly as decentralized finance (DeFi) becomes more popular.

AAVE liquidity protocol offers several unique features that differentiate it from its competitors, including the ability to borrow funds without collateral through its flash loan functionality, the ability to swap between different collateral types, and the ability to stake AAVE tokens to earn rewards and vote on governance proposals.

AAVE liquidity protocol operates on the Ethereum blockchain and uses smart contracts to facilitate lending and borrowing activities. The platform also uses a range of other technologies, including off-chain price oracles to provide accurate asset pricing and integrated analytics tools to provide insights into user activity.


## Landscape:

AAVE liquidity protocol operates in the domain of decentralized finance (DeFi).

Decentralized finance has experienced significant growth and innovation over the last 5-10 years, with the emergence of new blockchain platforms, smart contract functionality, and the development of new DeFi applications such as lending platforms, decentralized exchanges, and stablecoins.

Some of the other major companies in the DeFi lending space include Compound, MakerDAO, and Uniswap.


## Results

AAVE liquidity protocol has had a significant impact on the DeFi space, with over $18 billion in total value locked (TVL) on the platform and over $2 billion in loans issued.

Some of the core metrics used to measure the success of companies in the domain of decentralized finance (DeFi), which includes Aave Protocol, are:

Total Value Locked (TVL): This measures the amount of assets, typically cryptocurrencies, that are deposited into the platform's smart contracts for lending, borrowing, or other financial activities.

Daily Active Users (DAU): This measures the number of unique users who interact with the platform on a daily basis.

Revenue or Protocol Fees: This measures the amount of fees generated by the platform from transactions, loans, or other activities.

User Retention: This measures the percentage of users who continue to use the platform over time.

In terms of Aave Protocol's performance, Aave is one of the largest DeFi protocols by TVL, with over $17 billion in assets locked in the protocol. Aave has also experienced consistent growth in terms of both TVL and the number of active users.

In terms of revenue, Aave generates protocol fees from borrowing and lending activities on the platform, with a fee rate that varies depending on the asset being used. The total amount of protocol fees generated by Aave has been consistently increasing over time.

Aave is considered to be a leader in the DeFi space and is often compared to other lending protocols such as Compound and MakerDAO. In terms of TVL, Aave has consistently been one of the top DeFi protocols, currently ranking second in terms of TVL. 

In terms of daily active users, Aave has also been performing well, with a consistently high number of users interacting with the platform daily.

In terms of revenue or protocol fees, Aave has also been performing well relative to its competitors, generating significant revenue from its lending and borrowing activities. However, it is worth noting that the DeFi space is still relatively new, and there is significant competition and innovation occurring within the space, which may impact Aave's performance in the future.

Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
DeFi has to produce, in other words, and not just be a place investors can park some capital and make yield. It has to answer the question of – why would I want to borrow in this currency or lend to someone in it? Why would I want to transfer money to someone in Timbuktu on this platform, in their token, instead of through a bank wire, straight to a bank the end-user has worked with for years?

Among the doubts, DeFi is finding its users.

What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? 
Ajaja says several core challenges need to be addressed in the DeFi world. Developers need to build better infrastructure to make it easier to build programs; market participants need better industry standards such as implementing know your customer rules; and “identity management” without compromising on the core tenets of decentralization.

Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
“DeFi is inherently complicated,” Ajaja says. “Tackling these challenges will reduce the barriers to entry.”

What will it take to make the idea adoptable? 
“The first wave of DeFi solutions created the foundation for a new era of finance. The second generation builds on this, learning from the challenges encountered and enhances functionality of first-gen protocols and widens the reach to traditional institutions,” says Rachid Ajaja, founder & CEO at AllianceBlock in The Netherlands.





“The ‘when’ depends on how soon regulation takes place,” says John Patrick Mullin, Co-Founder & Co-CEO of SOMA.finance, an SEC-compliant multi-asset decentralized exchange platform. “The masses tend to adopt new products when they see that they’re backed by legitimate organizations,” he says. “I think centralized finance and the new decentralized finance companies will have to work together to bring the best of both worlds – you get financial freedom from DeFi, and you get the sense of security from centralized finance.”

DeFi might become a household name when the big, well-known centralized finance companies (or CeFi in crypto parlance) join hands. CeFi is also crypto. Coinbase is a CeFi company. Account holders can earn interest on savings at Coinbase, borrow money in cryptocurrency and spend with a debit card linked to your balance with Coinbase. Decentralized finance is similar: you can do most things that traditional banks and CeFi firms support — earn interest, lend, trade assets and more. It is also global, peer-to-peer lending.

“CeFi is getting squeezed from both sides. On the one hand, they are entering a market where users are accustomed to zero fees, peer-to-peer transfers, and a self-custody experience,” says Kevin Lepsoe, Founder of Infinity Exchange, an institutional lending Protocol for Web3 based out of London. “On the other hand, they’re dealing with governments (with their CBDCs) and corporates who want direct access to the capital markets. It is critical that CeFi invest in DeFi, and encourage regulation to stay relevant and validate their continued existence.”

So the “merge” will be a hybrid of DeFi and CeFi crypto lending platforms. And the company that does this with DeFi will likely be the company that makes DeFi a branded product line that’s part of a bigger player – be it Coinbase or Crypto.com.

“DeFi and CeFi are inherently complementary in nature and offer differentiated financial services and products that solve different needs,” says Lucas Huang, co-founder of DeFi lending protocol Aurigami in Dubai.
